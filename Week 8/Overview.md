This week was not, on its own, very fruitful. Most of our group took extensions on the STAR report, so movement in the entire group was slow, and I was becoming aware of how much I'd programmed with no interventon. While writing my STAR report, I reflected on that and wanted to make my code easier for others to use. Around this time I may have added many functions which shortened the call to a static resource, in the spirit of the "Adapter" design pattern.

-	Jack makes a “sprint refactoring” branch, where all file paths are changed to organise code into appropriate folders. 
-	March 10th I create the branch “from-refactor” off of “sprint-refactor” and I merge “methods-(awesome)” into it, taking the time to resolve the large amount of merge conflicts which are inevitably made.
