Thoughts written in response to Tom's FTL suggestion

1)
- Planet to planet, on each one an encounter is triggered. Primary encounter type is combat.
- You play the card game against your opponent. On your turn, 1 or more cards are drawn simultaneously and you spend a currency to take the cards and put them in your hand.

- The player can reroll the drawn cards by answering skillsbuild questions, and spending a small amount of currency.
- If they get a question wrong, they're not allowed to reroll again until their next turn.

- = Get them answering questions not because they're expected to, but in a gambling-way. A desire to see cards reroll and get a "jackpot".
- Upsides: positions the questions closer to the "fun" of gameplay.
- Downsides: Requires more cards to exist to support a larger pool to be drawing from.
(Exmaple is inspired by backpack battles)

2)
- What if when the player rerolls their own cards, they also reroll the opponent's selection of cards.
- We could create a game of incomplete information where the opponents' options are obscured (face down) but the player is still given partial information on them.
- Choosing whether to reroll to either stick the opponent with less useful cards or to give yourself better win condition cards gives the game more variety.

Examples:
- ex1: First 2 cards face up, next 2 cards are face down.
- ex2: All cards face down. The back of the cards belies the cards' rarities, category, or power.
Video games often convey rarity/power using a coloured aura. Identical face down cards could have coloured auras around them in our game, like that.
