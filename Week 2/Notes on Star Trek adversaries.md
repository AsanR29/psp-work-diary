Notes on Star Trek adversaries

- Decks: Federation, Klingon, Neutral

- You take 20 cards from between those decks, made of ship and crew cards.
- Creator recommends more ships than crew, and a good balance of cheaper cards.
- You can have a maximum of 8 legendary cards (gold border).

Flagships
- One of the large cards, each representing a different starship class.
- This is your player life.
- Ships has 8 corresponding core cards.
- Core cards don't get shuffled, but form a seperate deck near your flagship.

- Special: 20 Aux
- Ultimate: 40 Aux
- When a non-legendary core cards is used or destroyed, shuffle it back into your core deck.
- Legendary core cards can only be used one per game.

- Summon cards can be summoned by other cards.

Setup
- Pick flagships and place facing eachother, with enough space for 4 rows of cards inbetween them.
- Put core cards to the left of your flagship and your deck underneath the flagship.


The status effects are kind of similiar to backpack battles. They affect attacks, ability to attack, impact of attacks made, etc. They're not like "apply Poison Damage overtime".
In backpack battles theres poison which deals X damage every second, but theres also regeneration which heals X damage every second, and theres spikes which deals X damage back against whoever attacked you. In that game its all centered around points of damage applied to who or where (bar the blindness but i didn't see that used often). It seems the same in this game.

Also we played with the wrong rules. When you attack a ship, they automatically attack back even on your own turn. Explains why our match took forever.
Also, if you play with too few ships then you are guaranteed to lose, basically. I did that and I couldn't maneurvere onto the board safely. I also lacked useful mechancis such as "stealth" ships, and the inability for dead-on-arrival ships to whittle down the opponent was a huge factor too. Its like a balancing factor, that takes both players to an equilibrium of present-strength.
