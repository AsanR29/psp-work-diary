Card game mechanics:

1)
- It could be an "auto battler" so that enemies use decks built by real people - multiplayer without connection, only needing communication with our server.

2)
- Enemy decks could be sourced from players, but played by an AI trained using Watson.
- Each level of progression is trained independently, no matter how well trained the AI is the outcome should (hopefully) mostly come down to how well-built the deck is (which will be determined by the average of players)

3)
- Cards as NPCs, centered around ships.

Balatro has: Playing Card, Joker Card, Consumable cards, Voucher cards, Booster Packs.
The Jokers are reminiscent of "trick" suits which some traditional card games apparently use.
Each round has you playing poker, alone, until you score enough points to pass.

4)
- NPC cards are equivalent to ordinary suites.
- Each NPC could have a "character arc" with 2 or 3 simple steps to fulfill. Represented as a meter.
- Every round that a step is not fulfilled, their arc deprecates by 1 or empties.
- When the character arc is completed, the NPC card transforms into a member of the 5th suit, a "Trump card" suit where they can be consumed for a special effect.
- This has a chance of consuming them permanently or of refunding them.
- Suicidal life-risking moves for the culmination of their silly star-trek storyline. Like episodes of the show.
