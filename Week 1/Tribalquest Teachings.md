Tribalquest Teachings

1)
- For headers of tables, a gradient of light to dark is used.
- The background image is a 1x18 image, for example, and set 'background-repeat: repeat-x;' 
- Then, the background colour is the darkest shade of the gradient, allowing the element to be taller -it wants to brighten the top to soften the element.
- 1x18 might take longer to render, but 10x18 probably wouldn't be much slower than 100x18. Also, who cares tho until the site actually lags.

2)
- Everything is assembled using table elements. Like genuinely tables within tables; tables all the way down.
- But curiously, sometimes the header is not a table element. I think for the sake of the text  buttons being "free" of table constraint & shenanigans.
