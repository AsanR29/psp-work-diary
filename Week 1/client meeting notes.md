- Big focus on AI. Nobody uses their AI courses (problem).

- They want gameification to encourage learning. Lighthearted & easy gameplay.
- Huge star trel fam (if we make a star trek rippff, will he be happy?)

- As opposed to resources = Answered questions
- talking about Civilsation research (civ5?). (Now I'm thinking about thaumcraft research)

- They have "badges" in their courses fpr completing quizzes.
- He recommends doing their courses, completing the Q&A.

- Event = NPC says "we need to know the answer to X" then you resolve it using the course knowledge.

- Dudes forgotten about the VR option. He really wants the game.

- Completely discreet application. Webgame, browser, App, anything allowed.
- If you can: Multiplayer game. A leaderboard (between friends)

- "counterspy" he mentioned a mechanic where dead characters are in the world & can be looted = loot your friends' bodies, kind of like when you fight your own ghost in DCSS? Loved that mechanic

- Treat as a singleplayer game, use multiplayer only for encouragement. Not gameplay. And the multiplayer is a stretchgoal.

- Multiple choice questions? He can provide link to badges to derive QA from.

- Special buffcards = Represent a buff rather than being a card card.
- Roguelite where you can pick up a new fresh save, but that new progression will enhance your accounts' power on subsequent playthroughs?

- He thinks Tribal Wars' longform characteristics are useful. Counterspy = "Frantic" experience.

- Put the link for skills build at the game start, recommend startup, reward cards/badges for interacting with the website. But you can still play without doing that.

- HE REALLY DID FORGET THE VR. A STUDENT JUST REMINDED HIM!

- "Star trek commander" = A VR game? Vr adventure game.
- Alright. VR experience is 1 thing, but VR *game* is too hard.
- Hes a gamer dude. Skyrim namedropped. Bro, say morrowind... why skyrim.
- They're talking about VR games. Hes using a bored-ish tone, hes enthusiastic when talking about 1# star trek, #2 counterspy.

- "I love science fiction", "I'm a nerd"
- We're allowed to email him, he says. Email repeatedly if he doesn't respond, he says.
